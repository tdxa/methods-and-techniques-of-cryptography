# Assigment 02: Hash functions

- [x] Implement hashing with all the functions returned by `algorithms_available ` from the `hashlib` library along with returning information about hash time  for the input data.
  

- [ ] Download a larg file (e.g. Ubuntu) and check if the hash is correct.


- [ ] Implement a function that hashes any binary file from disk. Check it out by hashing the Ubuntu image from point 2.


- [ ] Use the `timeit` package to investigate speed of generating hashes for messages of different sizes.
Grap this using `matplotlib` (_less recommended_) or `plotly` (_recommended_)
