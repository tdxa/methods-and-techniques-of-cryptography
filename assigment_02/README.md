# Assigment 02: Hash functions

## Todo

- [x] Implement hashing with all the functions returned by `algorithms_available ` from the `hashlib` library with returning information about hash time  for the input data.
  

- [x] Download a large file (e.g. Ubuntu) and check if the hash is correct.


- [x] Implement a function that hashes any binary file from disk. Check it out by hashing the Ubuntu image from point 2.

   _The `filehash(path)` function validation can be found in the form of a test in the **`test_utillities.py`** file. The Ubuntu version used is 20.04.2.0-desktop._

- [x] Use the `timeit` package to investigate speed of generating hashes for messages of different sizes.
Grap this using `matplotlib` (_less recommended_) or `plotly` (_recommended_)

<hr>

The `matplotlib` library was used to prepare the graph. Here is the result of the function call:
